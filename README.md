## Inspiration

Sign Together was formed out of the team's inspiration to help a target demographic (ie. the deaf) by utilizing advancing technologies such as computer vision and artificial intelligence.

## What it does

Sign Together allows users to play iterations of the game where users are asked to recall what sign language sign refers to each letter that appears on the screen.

## How we built it

The core computer vision functionality is powered by an Azure Custom Vision Engine which interacts with the Node/Express/React web stack. Game user data is stored in a firebase database. 

## Challenges we ran into

We faced multiple pivots early on in the development process due to which demographic we wanted to target with our gesture detecting Azure model.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're very proud of creating a highly accurate hand detection model as well as a user-friendly & interactive web app.

## What we learned

We learned that computer vision has extensive applications for many social solutions.

## What's next for SignTogether

Further functionality with other games that utilize hand gestures for other target demographics.
